# Celery Test
 Celery Test is a Django-based project demonstrating the integration of Celery with Redis for handling asynchronous tasks. The project includes a real-world example where tasks are queued and processed in real-time using Celery workers. This setup is useful for handling background jobs like sending emails, processing large datasets, or real-time notifications.
